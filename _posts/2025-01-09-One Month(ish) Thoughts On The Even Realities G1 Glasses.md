About a month ago I purchased my first pair of prescription smart glasses, the [Even Realities G1s](https://www.evenrealities.com/g1). In this post I am going to outline the major pros and cons I have encountered after a month of living in the future with the G1s.

# Pros
- Battery Life
  - The battery life on the G1s is amazing! Most of the time I get to the end of my day with 60% or more battery life left. At that rate I think that these will do just fine while traveling, but I will put that to the test this August with Defcon 33. 
- Simplicity
  - I may be in the minority here, based on my friends and coworkers initial reactions to the G1s, but I love that the G1s only do a few things and those things are presented in a minimal no nonsense way. In my mind I want smart glassess to improve my day to day life, not further distract me from it. I'm happy with my simple green Fallout HUD that only does a few things, but does those things pretty damn well.
- Construction
  - The frames feel good. They don't feel like I have to baby them. They don't feel heavy.  They don't feel cheap. Overall I'm just pretty happy with the frames feel.
- Comfort
  - Speaking of the frame's feel, I think that these are wicked comfortable. They are well balanced and I can wear these for hours with no problems at all. If I put the G1s into silent mode, I can sorta forget that I am wearing smart glasses at all.
- Weather Resistance
  - When I initially had some hesitation about how these would hold up in the cold. I can now say that they hold up pretty well! I have not encountered any issues even exposing them to temperatures as cold as -32Â°F!
- Discreetness
  - For the most part, the G1s look like you are wearing a normal pair of glasses. It is only at certain angles where you would be able to catch a green flash across the lens. Most of the people I talked to just assumed that the rectangular box (where the image is projected) on the lenses was just some type of bifocal.
 
# Cons
- Connection
  - I'd say that about 95% of the time I am extremely happy with the connection from my smartphone to the G1s. However there has been a time or two where I found that one side of my glasses had disconnected from my phone while the other hasn't leaving me with an image projected to only a single eye, which can be nausea inducing. That said, all but once I was able to just repair the disconnected side and get back to my day. however, The one time that I was unable to resulted in me completely unpairing the glasses from my Bluetooth and the ER app. Then having to go through the initial pair process again. Unfortunately, that requires you to place the glasses back into the case, which you may not have while out and about.
- Artifacts and Reflections
  - This might be the most irritating part of these glasses for me. I find myself while wearing these to encounter a lot of reflected light traveling across my lenses. These blue streaks can honestly be pretty distracting depending on the surrounding lighting. Perhaps this is due to a lens coating, but I am hoping that if that is the case it will improve with time.
- Comfort While Wearing Over The Ear Headphones
  - I have found that dependning on the type of over the ear headphones used the G1s can go from being almost unnoticeable all the way to downright painful. This is due to the cup pressure and headphone weight being applied to the battery and control housing located behind the ears on the G1s frame. I don't neccessarily fault the G1s for this as I think it is a worth while tradeoff to achieve the balance that the glasses have while sitting on your face. However, it is worht noting as you may need to choose between wearing your favorite over the ears or the G1s.
